## App overview

This repo contains the backend/server side of the full-stack **MERN** application. This application lets the users to pin the places which they visited across the globe and write the comments about the things they liked most about that place and also provide with the suitable ratings. The application also comes with the login and registration functionality. Anybody can view the pins which are already marked by the other users. A user can create the pins if and only if he/she is logged in to the application. The application is tested on **Google Chrome** browser.

This application is built by keeping in mind the best practices which can be used to develop a full-stack application. Although, perfection and learning is an life-long process so I will continue to make use of best practices going along. Please visit **[here](https://github.com/mandy8055/pinThePlace#readme)** for detailed overview of the frontend architecture.

## Features

1. Password is encrypted inside mongoDB collection.
2. The application is made **sql-injection** proof. Although, some more work might be needed.
3. Vulnerabilities are dealt in the best possible way.
4. The routes are handled properly.
5. CORS bug is handled properly.

**CHECKLIST [TODO]:**
- [x] Compress the slug size.
- [ ] Implement user-friendly logger using best practices.
- [ ] Make efficient use of cluster.
- [x] Set up various HTTP headers to prevent attacks like Cross-Site-Scripting(XSS), click-jacking, etc.
- [ ] Implement forgot password and change password functionality in the app.
- [ ] Implement different user registration options like Google and facebook login.
